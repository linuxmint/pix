Compiling
=========

  In order to build this program you need a working GNOME environment
  version 2 or greater, with the development tools installed properly.
  The following is the detailed list of libraries you need:

	* glib	 		version >= 2.16.0
	* gtk 			version >= 2.18.0
	* gthread
 	* gmodule
	* gio-unix
	* gconf			version >= 2.6.0
	* intltool		version >= 0.35.0
	* unique		version >= 1.1.2


  While not mandatory, these libraries greatly increase gThumb's
  basic usefulness:

	* exiv2			version >= 0.18
	  (embedded metadata support)

	* gstreamer		version >= 0.10
	  (video support)

	* libjpeg

  These libraries are optional:

          (This adds some support for RAW photos)


  If dcraw is present (and is in your executable search path), 
  gthumb can view full RAW photos.

  are implemented as extensions and are supplied with the standard
