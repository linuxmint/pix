Compiling
=========

  In order to build this program you need a working GNOME environment
  version 2 or greater, with the development tools installed properly.
  The following is the detailed list of libraries you need:

	* glib	 		version >= 2.16.0
	* gtk 			version >= 2.18.0
	* gthread
 	* gmodule
	* gio-unix
	* gconf			version >= 2.6.0
	* intltool		version >= 0.35.0
	* unique		version >= 1.1.2


  While not mandatory, these libraries greatly increase Pix's
  basic usefulness:

	* exiv2			version >= 0.18
	  (embedded metadata support)

	* gstreamer		version >= 0.10
	  (video support)

	* libjpeg
	* libtiff
	  (jpeg and tiff writing support)


  These libraries are optional:

	* clutter		version >= 1.0.0
	* clutter-gtk		version >= 0.10.0
          (These libraries provide enhanced slideshow effects.)

	* libopenraw		version >= 0.0.8
          (This adds some support for RAW photos)


  If dcraw is present (and is in your executable search path),
  Pix can view full RAW photos.


Extensions

  Pix has a plug-in system for extensions. Some standard features
  are implemented as extensions and are supplied with the standard
  distribution. Users may write (and share) additional extensions.
