License: GFDL-1.1+
 		GNU Free Documentation License
 		   Version 1.1, March 2000
 .
  Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 .
 0. PREAMBLE
 .
 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
 the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
 modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
 this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
 credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
 modifications made by others.
 .
 This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
 can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
 such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
 addressed as "you".
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
 designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
 that the Document is released under this License.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
 Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
 Document is released under this License.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
 public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
 automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
 formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
 markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
 by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
 called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
 without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
 using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
 designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript,
 PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary
 word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
 are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by
 some word processors for output purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
 such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
 License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
 do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
 most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of
 the body of the text.
 .
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
 or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and
 the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced
 in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of
 this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
 reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
 may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large
 enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
 publicly display copies.
 .
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
 Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in
 covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
 on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
 clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
 must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
 changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
 and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
 should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover,
 and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
 you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque
 copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network
 location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
 material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously
 at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option,
 you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
 copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus
 accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you
 distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
 edition to the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
 well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
 provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions
 of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under
 precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
 thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
 possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
     * A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
          of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there
          were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
          gives permission.
     * B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
          responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
          together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of
          its principal authors, if it has less than five).
     * C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
          as the publisher.
     * D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     * E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
          other copyright notices.
     * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
          the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
          License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
     * G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
          required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
     * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     * I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
          item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
          Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
          entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
          authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
          add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
          sentence.
     * J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
          access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
          locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
          These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
          location for a work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.
     * K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
          the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and
          tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
          therein.
     * L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
          text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
          considered part of the section titles.
     * M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
          included in the Modified Version.
     * N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
          title with any Invariant Section. 
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
 qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
 you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
 do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
 Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
 titles.
 .
 You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but
 endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements
 of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the
 authoritative definition of a standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of
 up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the
 Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
 may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
 already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
 arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
 another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
 publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission
 to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any
 Modified Version.
 .
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under
 the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include
 in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
 unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical
 Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant
 Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section
 unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
 publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
 to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
 combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various
 original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any
 sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You
 must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."
 .
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released
 under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various
 documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
 follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
 other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually
 under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted
 document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying
 of that document.
 .
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent
 documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not
 as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
 copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate",
 and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with
 the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
 derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the
 Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate,
 the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document
 within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
 .
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations
 of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with
 translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
 include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original
 versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License
 provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case
 of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this
 License, the original English version will prevail.
 .
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly
 provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or
 distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
 in full compliance.
 .
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
 Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
 spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
 or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later
 version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published
 (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify
 a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 .
 How to use this License for your documents
 .
 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License
 in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the
 title page:
 .
       Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
       Free Documentation License".
 .
 If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead of
 saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write "no
 Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
 Back-Cover Texts.
 .
 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
 releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license,
 such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
